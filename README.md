## Usage

* The current date displays at the top of the page
* There are timeblocks for each hour between 9AM and 5PM
* Time blocks are supposed to be color coded based on whether it is the past, present or future time - this was not working at my time blocks are not taking up the correct amount of space (???)
* I am struggling to get anything to show up in local storage 

## Images

## Credits

As I have said with each preceding homework assignment, I want to thank Bootcamp Spot, the University of Washington and Trilogy Eduction for the assignment and code they provided. This assignment was very challenging, I am not quite there yet but it has been great practice. Thank you to the instructor and TA's for their dedication and patience. I also want to give thanks to my tutor, Zach Auerbach, for his dedication and help.
