## Credits

As I have said with each preceding homework assignment, I want to thank Bootcamp Spot, the University of Washington and Trilogy Eduction for the assignment and code they provided. This assignment was very challenging, I am not quite there yet but it has been great practice. Thank you to the instructor and TA's for their dedication and patience. I also want to give thanks to my tutor, Zach Auerbach, for his dedication and help.
